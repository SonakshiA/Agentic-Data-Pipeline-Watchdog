# Agentic-Data-Pipeline-Watchdog
This project implements an automated data cleaning pipeline using an agentic approach powered by Azure OpenAI, LangGraph, and Pandas. It reads raw data, checks for quality issues, generates cleaning code via an LLM, and applies the cleaningâ€”all orchestrated through a stateful graph.
